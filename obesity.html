<h1>Obesity</h1> 
    
  <h2>What is Obesity</h2>  
  <ul>
    <li>Obesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It is a medical problem that increases your risk of other diseases and health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain cancers.</li>
  </ul> 
    
    <h2>Obesity Facts</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li>Obesity means having excess body fat. Adults 35 years of age and older with a BMI greater than 30 are obese.</li>
      <li>Obesity is not just a cosmetic consideration. It is a chronic medical disease that can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity associated cardiovascular disease such as heart disease, gallstones, and other chronic illnesses.</li>
      <li>Obesity is a risk factor for a number of cancers.</li>
      <li>Obesity is difficult to treat and has a high relapse rate. Most people who lose weight regain the weight within five years.</li> 
      <li>Even though medications and diets can help, the treatment of obesity cannot be a short-term "fix" but has to be a lifelong commitment to proper diet habits, increased physical activity, and regular exercise</li> 
      <li>The goal of treatment should be to achieve and maintain a "healthier weight," not necessarily an ideal weight.</li>
      <li>Even a modest weight loss of 5%-10% of initial weight and the long-term maintenance of that weight loss can bring significant health benefits by lowering blood pressure and lowering the risks of diabetes and heart disease.</li>
      <li>The chances of long-term successful weight loss are enhanced if the doctor works with a team of professionals, including dietitians, psychologists, and exercise professionals.</li>       
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Obesity Diagnosis and Treatment</h2> 
    <ul>
     <li>Taking your health history. Your doctor may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits, eating patterns and appetite control, what other conditions you've had, medications, stress levels, and other issues about your health. Your doctor may also review your family's health history to see if you may be predisposed to certain conditions.</li>
     <li>A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen./li>    
     <li>Calculating your BMI. Your doctor will check your body mass index (BMI). A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase your health risks even more. Your BMI should be checked at least once a year because it can help determine your overall health risks and what treatments may be appropriate.</li>
     <li>Measuring your waist circumference. Fat stored around your waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase your risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist measurement (circumference) of more than 35 inches (89 centimeters, or cm) and men with a waist measurement of more than 40 inches (102 cm) may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, your waist circumference should be checked at least once a year.</li>
